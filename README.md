### Note: This repo was the basis for a site launched in the City of Long Beach in 2016. While the City maintains (as of 2019-09-14) a *similar* site based on this codebase, this codebase is no longer under development, and is entirely separate from the codebase used in production by the city.

# BizPort Business Portal

BizPort is an open-source codebase that you can use to set up a business portal in any city. It was originally built for the City of Long Beach, California. You can visit their live version at bizport.longbeach.gov.

If you're a **city staff member or strategist** that wants to redeploy the site in your city, have a look at the [guide to redeployment](docs/REDEPLOYMENT.md).

If you're a **developer** trying to set up BizPort on your own laptop or in production, check out the [developer docs](docs/DEVELOPER_SETUP.md).

If you're a **content editor** learning how to edit copy in the content management system (CMS), the [content editing docs](docs/EDITING.md) are a great place to start.

BizPort is open source under the MIT License, which you are encouraged to read in its entirety [here](LICENSE.md).
